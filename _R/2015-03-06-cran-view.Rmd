Almost everyone with an R package in CRAN wonders how often it's installed and used. Two years ago [RStudio kindly started offering anonymized logs of their downloads from their CRAN mirror](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/), which allows one to [graph the number of downloads over time](http://www.r-bloggers.com/finally-tracking-cran-packages-downloads/). Much easier than downloading and processing all of the log files, however, is working with RStudio's [JSON API](https://github.com/metacran/cranlogs.app), (which can be accessed with [cranlogs](https://github.com/metacran/cranlogs)) to find downloads-per-day statistics for any specific package.

To make plotting a package's downloads even easier, I've used that API to create a [Shiny app](https://dgrtwo.shinyapps.io/cranview/)! Simply type in any package in CRAN, select the amount of time you want to graph over, and voila:

[You can find the code for the app here](https://github.com/dgrtwo/cranview). Enjoy!
