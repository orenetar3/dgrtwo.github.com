Ended up a few lines behind? Want to check that your spelling of the last line was correct? No problem: these pages contain the live contents of the files that are being written and executed on the screen. They're synced by Dropbox and may take a few seconds to get up to date.

* [R Error Message Cheat Sheet](/courses/errors): contains some common R error messages. If you get an error while running a line that you expect to work (perhaps because you saw it on the screen), check these examples before you go to the Google docs. (In particular, check your spelling and capitalization carefully).
