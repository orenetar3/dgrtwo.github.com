Welcome to Wintersession 1014, **Data Analysis and Visualization Using R**. The course takes place on **Mon/Wed/Fri 1/26-30, from 1:30-3 PM, in McCosh 10.** Please make sure to complete the following *before* coming to lecture:

* Bring a **fully charged laptop**,
* **Install the latest version of R** (3.1.2), which can be done [here](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/). If you already have R installed, make sure your version is the same one (3.1.2), and if it's not, upgrade!

Important Links
---------------

* **R Live Feed** [Link TBA]: Ended up a few lines behind? Want to check that your spelling of the last line was correct? No problem: this page contains the live contents of the file that's being written and executed on the screen. It is synced by Dropbox and may take a few seconds to get up to date.
* [R Error Message Cheat Sheet](/courses/errors): contains some common R error messages. If you get an error while running a line that you expect to work (perhaps because you saw it on the screen), check these examples before you go to the Google docs. (In particular, check your spelling and capitalization carefully).
* [My online course](/RData/) A free online course I developed that includes videos and code transcripts for the material covered in this workshop and more
* [Resources for future learning](/RData/resources/) A page of additional resources for learning R
